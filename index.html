                <h2><b>Choosing the Right Nail Salon Matters</b></h2><p><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">Your hands and feet endure daily wear and tear, making nail care an essential part of your wellness. But choosing the right salon goes beyond aesthetics. Hygiene, professionalism, and a commitment to using high-quality products are non-negotiable factors when it comes to protecting your health and achieving lasting results. Maintaining proper hygiene in salons is essential, as studies show that disruptions to the skin’s natural microbiome can impact overall skin health and barrier function.</span></p><p><span
